=============================================================================
Statistical Coupling Analysis in python.
=============================================================================

The Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA) is an approach for
characterizing the pattern of evolutionary constraints on and between
amino acid positions in a protein family. Given a representative
multiple sequence alignment of the family, the analysis provides
methods for quantitatively measuring the overall functional constraint
at each sequence position (the position-specific, or "first-order"
analysis of conservation), and for measuring and analyzing the coupled
functional constraint on all pairs of sequence positions (the
pairwise-correlated, or "second-order" analysis of conservation). The
premise is that extending the traditional definition of conservation
to include correlations between positions will contribute to defining
the architecture of functional interactions between amino acids, and
more importantly, help define the basic physical principles underlying
protein structure, function, and evolution.
