Distributions
==================

Previous versions of SCA were implemented as MATLAB toolboxes and
contain various accessory codes for data formatting, display, and analysis. Previous versions include:

(1) SCA Toolbox 1.5: The original SCA method as specified in Lockless and Ranganathan (4) with one modification that was used in all subsequent papers: the division of binomial probabilities by the mean probability of amino acids in the alignment is removed. This version is longer in active use.

(2) SCA Toolbox 2.5: The bootstrap-based approach for SCA. Position-specific conservation calculated as in Eq. (4) and correlations calculated as in Eq. (9). Matrix reduction per Eq. (32).

(3) SCA Toolbox 3.0: The analytical calculation of correlations weighted by gradients of relative entropy. Position-specific conservation calculated as in Eq. (4) and correlations calculated as in Eq. (9)-(33). For non-binarized alignments, matrix reduction is per Eq. (32).

(4) SCA Toolbox 4.0: Analytical calculations as in v3.0, but now including sector identification methods as described in Ref. (2).

(5) SCA Toolbox 5.0: Calculation of positional and sequence
    correlations matrices by the alignment projection method as per
    Eq.  (19) and Eq.  (20), and calculation of the mapping between
    them (Eq.  (21). Includes methods for sector identification and
    exploring relationships between positional and sequence
    correlations.
